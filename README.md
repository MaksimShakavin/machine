# machine

My machine setup, powered by Ansible.


## Usage:

```console
$ wget https://github.com/caarlos0/machine/archive/master.zip
$ unzip machine-master.zip
$ cd machine-master
```

In this point, you might want to edit `main.yml` file and comment out stuff you
don't want. Then:

```console
$ ./setup
```
